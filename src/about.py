st.markdown("""The [ExtraTime Radio podcast](https://www.mlssoccer.com/video/topics/extratime/) (RIP 🪦) held the first Golden Boot Draft in 2021.
[Andrew Wiebe](https://bsky.app/profile/andrew-wiebe.bsky.social), [Calen Carr](https://www.calencarr.com/mystory), [David Gass](https://bsky.app/profile/empiregass.bsky.social), and [Matt Doyle](https://bsky.app/profile/mattdoyle.bsky.social) took part in the inaugural draft by selecting 2 players each.
In 2022, the team size was increased to 4 players. In 2023, [Tom Bogert](https://bsky.app/profile/tombogert.bsky.social) replaced Calen and each team was allowed to keep one player from the previous year.
In 2025, Producer Anders and [Morgan](https://bsky.app/profile/morgantencza.bsky.social) (Admin) joined in on the fun.
